<p>Trade Federation (tradefed or TF for short) is a continuous test framework designed for running tests
on Android devices. It's a Java application which runs on a host computer, and communicates to one or
more Android devices using ddmlib (the library behind DDMS) over adb.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>modular, flexible, scalable design</li>
<li>has built in support for running many different types of Android tests:
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing_android.html#Instrumentation">instrumentation</a>,
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing_ui.html">uiautomator</a>,
  native/gtest, host-based JUnit, etc</li>
<li>provides reliability and recovery mechanisms on top of adb</li>
<li>supports scheduling and running tests on multiple devices in parallel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample Trade Federation Usecases</h2>
<p><b>FIXME</b>: can these be dynamically expandable?</p>
<ul>
<li class="collapsible">
  <div class="section-header">
    <span class="en">Device OEM</span>
  </div>
  <p>A device OEM will be interested in some things and will need some bits of extra infrastructure</p>
</li>
<li>Platform Integrator</li>
<li>App Developer</li>
<li>Test Service Builder</li>
</ul>
