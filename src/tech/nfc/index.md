# NFC Technical Information #
*Placeholder*

The Android Open-Source Project also includes an NFC implementation. Unlike
the Android Bluetooth stack, much of the Android NFC stack is new code
originally contributed to the Android Open-Source Project. This code links the
Android NFC API to a device's NFC hardware. This section also includes
information on related Android technologies, such as the simple NDEF Push
Protocol.
